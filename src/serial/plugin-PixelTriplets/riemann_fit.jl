    #  Compute the Radiation length in the uniform hypothesis
    # *
    # * The Pixel detector, barrel and forward, is considered as an omogeneous
    # * cilinder of material, whose radiation lengths has been derived from the TDR
    # * plot that shows that 16cm correspond to 0.06 radiation lengths. Therefore
    # * one radiation length corresponds to 16cm/0.06 =~ 267 cm. All radiation
    # * lengths are computed using this unique number, in both regions, barrel and
    # * endcap.
    # *
    # * NB: no angle corrections nor projections are computed inside this routine.
    # * It is therefore the responsibility of the caller to supply the proper
    # * lengths in input. These lenghts are the path travelled by the particle along
    # * its trajectory, namely the so called S of the helix in 3D space.
    # *
    # * \param length_values vector of incremental distances that will be translated
    # * into radiation length equivalent. Each radiation length i is computed
    # * incrementally with respect to the previous length i-1. The first lenght has
    # * no reference point (i.e. it has the dca).
    # *
    # * \return incremental radiation lengths that correspond to each segment.

    # \brief Compute the covariance matrix along cartesian S-Z of points due to
    # multiple Coulomb scattering to be used in the line_fit, for the barrel
    # and forward cases.
    # The input covariance matrix is in the variables s-z, original and
    # unrotated.
    # The multiple scattering component is computed in the usual linear
    # approximation, using the 3D path which is computed as the squared root of
    # the squared sum of the s and z components passed in.
    # Internally a rotation by theta is performed and the covariance matrix
    # returned is the one in the direction orthogonal to the rotated S3D axis,
    # i.e. along the rotated Z axis.
    # The choice of the rotation is not arbitrary, but derived from the fact that
    # putting the horizontal axis along the S3D direction allows the usage of the
    # ordinary least squared fitting techiques with the trivial parametrization y
    # = mx + q, avoiding the patological case with m = +/- inf, that would
    # correspond to the case at eta = 0.
